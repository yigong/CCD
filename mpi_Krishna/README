You will have to copy the files in this directory to your place,
modify them and use to bundle your serial jobs into one
single parallel job.

There are four main files in this directory.

1) jobs-list : This is the file in which you will list all
your serial programs with input parameters and optionally
redirect the out from each serial program into a different
output file. Now I have listed some simple programs like
'ls', 'hostname' & 'pwd' in there. Remove them and list your
serial programs one per each line.

2) my_script.pl & 3) getid : These are a PERL script and a binary
which you need not touch or modify. Just make sure you have
them available in your working directory.

and finally
4) submit.qsub.lr : This is your PBS job submit script. You will have
to modify a lot in this script according to the job you are about
to submit. On the mpirun line change the number of tasks after
'-np' but leave the "./my_script.pl jobs-list" part as it is.
You are listing all your serial programs in jobs-list file.
